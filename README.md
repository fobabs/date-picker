This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

- If you like the project, give it a star. It means a lot to me.

## Requirements

- Git should be installed [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Nodejs [Install Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). **Notice v11.11.0 breaks the tests**
- Yarn (we recommend using yarn as a package manager) [Install Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
